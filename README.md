This is a simple prank that I wrote in like an hour. Please don't use it maliciously.

## Description

This is a super simple program that will shut down your windows based computer between the time of 10:00PM and 7AM.
I wrote this in an hour so it's not very complex, but it gets the job done.
All it does is create a copy of itself in the users startup folder and then runs through an infinite loop.
Please don't use this maliciously, but maybe if you want to mess with your friends.
